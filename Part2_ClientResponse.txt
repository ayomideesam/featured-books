Subject: RESOLVED - Books Archive iPhone Display Issue

Hi Bob,
Thank you for bringing this to our attention! I'm happy to confirm that the iPhone display issue with your Books Archive page has been completely resolved.

What was causing the problem:
Your website page wasn't properly "talking" to mobile devices like iPhones. Think of it like having a large poster designed for a wall - when you try to shrink it down to fit in a small picture frame, everything becomes cramped and hard to read. That's essentially what was happening when people viewed your books page on their phones.
The page was designed primarily for computer screens, so when iPhones tried to display it, they were unable to properly display the desktop layout into a much smaller space. This caused the books to appear tiny and inconsistently arranged because the phone was trying its best to squeeze a "computer-sized" layout into a "phone-sized" screen.

What I've done to fix it:
I've updated your Books Archive page to be "responsive", which means it now automatically adapts to whatever device someone is using. 

Here's what you'll notice:
On iPhones: Books now display beautifully in a single column (1 per row) as you requested, making them easy to read and tap.
On Tablets: They'll show 2 books per row for optimal viewing
On Computers or Larger Screens: They maintain the original 3-column layout you liked

The page now "knows" what type of device is viewing it and automatically adjusts the layout accordingly. This ensures your content looks professional and is easy to use regardless of whether someone visits on their phone, tablet, or computer.

Next steps:
You can test this by viewing the page on your iPhone again - you should see a much cleaner, easier-to-navigate layout with books displayed one per row, properly sized for mobile viewing.

Bonus improvement: I've also optimized the page loading speed on mobile devices, so your visitors will have an even better experience.

If you have any questions or notice anything else that needs attention, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Ayomide
